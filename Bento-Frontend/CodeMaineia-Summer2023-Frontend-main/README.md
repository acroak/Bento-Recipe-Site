### Third Party Library

[Framer Motion Library](https://github.com/framer/motion)
[Library live Docs](https://www.framer.com/motion/)

#### Misc design notes

##### Logo font:

[Handlee](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Handlee?preview.text=BENTO&preview.text_type=custom&query=handlee) - To be used for Headers, uppercased text

[Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) - to be used as primary body font, anything other than headers/accent areas

##### Potential Color Palettes:
![bento_pallette](https://media.github.khoury.northeastern.edu/user/12000/files/bd67d37f-a01d-486d-8aad-47671d78d48b)

##### Icon Sources:
[Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/) Prof. Mullen mentioned this one in class, if theres a different bento image you'd prefer for the logo just LMK.

[Icon Finder](https://www.iconfinder.com/) Good for social media icons
